# Hortonworks Data Platform on IBM Power - Solution Toolkit v1.0

## Introduction
This repository contains instructions, guidelines, and automation tools for deploying (provisioning) an IBM Power-based cluster that is designed to host an installation of Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP).

## 


  A complete solution consists of the cluster infrastructure and an installation of HDP software on that cluster infrastructure.  The scope of this document covers the deployment of the cluster infrastructure – hardware (server, storage, network), systems software (operating systems), and management software.  Installation of the HDP software is not covered by this document.  It is recommended that a Hortonworks consultant be retained to accomplish the HDP software installation.
This document is part of a published toolkit – the “Hortonwork Data Platform on IBM Power Solution Toolkit” (hereafter referenced as the “HDP on Power Solution Toolkit”) --, and this document contains references and links to other materials in that toolkit.




is a comprehensive set of instructions, rules, and automation tools for building an OpenPOWER-based cluster tuned for Accelerated Databases(database making use of any accelerators).  Examples of such accelerated databases include Kinetica's GPUdb.  This repository currently facilitates Kinetica's GPUdb, but support for other Accelerated Databases to be added in the future.
