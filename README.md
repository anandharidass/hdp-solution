# Hortonworks Data Platform on IBM Power Solution Toolkit v1.0

## Introduction
This repository contains instructions, guidelines, and automation tools for deploying an IBM Power-based cluster designed to host an installation of Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP).  The deployment process covers the assembly and configuration of the cluster infrastructure, including hardware, system software, and base configurations (e.g. network configuration).  The scope of the deployment process does not cover the installation of the HDP software proper.

## Contents
This repository is organized into the following:
- **Documents** (in the [/docs](docs/) directory)
    - The document [**How to Deploy an IBM OpenPOWER Cluster for Hortonworks Data Platform**](docs/HDP%20on%20Power%20-%20Deployment%20Guide%20v1.0.pdf) is the primary and starting reference for understanding and using this toolkit.
    - The other documents are referenced by and support the **How to Deploy an IBM OpenPOWER Cluster for Hortonworks Data Platform** document.
    
- **Input Files** (in the [/inputs](inputs/) directory)
    - These files are various machine readable content used as input to the deployment process and referenced by the automation scripts
        
- **Automation Scripts** (in the / directory)
    - These scripts are the primary automation scripts used by the deployment process
